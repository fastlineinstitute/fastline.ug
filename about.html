           <div class="about">Through our experience with Fastline Educational Consultancy Firm-Kampala, where we engaged so much in capacity building through workshops, trainings and conferences, we realized that there was more needed other than just capacity building. Basing on this background, 
               we mobilized resources and established FASTLINE INSTITUTE OF HIGHER EDUCATION-Kampala in 2016. Initially, we started with the Department of Education with a bias in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) where we basically trained nursery teachers. The initial students came from 
               our clients of Fastline Educational Consultancy Firm-Kampala, they were five (5) female students. Down the road, we expanded our horizon and established other departments such as; 
<p>
<ol><li>Department Of Agriculture</li> 
<li>Department of Vocational Studies.</li>
<li>Department of Liberal and performing art.</li>
<li>Department of science and technology.</li>
<li>Department of business administration and management.</li>
</ol></p>
    <p>Most of our students are mobilized from communities. These could the dropouts who left school because of lack of proper career guidance and counseling; those who dropout out because of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies, etc. We mobilize them, offer them career guidance and counseling and we encourage them to apply for any course of convenience. </p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>A literate and educated citizenry is so central in the society growth, transformation and development.</li>
<li>Education is a fundamental human right. Therefore, all people are entitled to high quality education provided in an environment that embraces professional integrity, positive thinking and dignity for all.</li>
<li>A dynamic education system and educationists foster equitable distribution of resources and finally a key opener to communal, national and global development.</li>
<li>Effective teaching and scholarly research is so central in an effective institution like Fastline Institute of Higher Education-Kampala.</li>
<li>Institutional development and improvement should be based on sound policies, programs, research, application of theories, management, leadership and administrative skills in collaboration with partners and practitioners.</li>
<li>Technology is so central in the modern world. Therefore should be used to improve the quality of teaching, learning, research and outreach in the community, nation and the world over.</li>
<li>Culture, inter-disciplinary programs and cross-cutting issues are so crucial in enhancing human learning, content mastery, holistic growth and development. That is why we aspire to be a leader in all spheres of the programs that we teach, engage in and prepare professional.</li>
